## Project details

This is a challenge project from [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/).
Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contained a series of open-ended requirements which described the project.
The starting app had the boilerplates for the components premade, as well as basic React Router set up ahead.
My task was to implement the logic and make the app actually work. This is my approach to the given tasks.

## Project's aim

This project's aim was to solidify the knowledge and practice even more on React functional components and hooks.
It is the last project on React at Codecademy before a dive into Redux.
My goal was to write the cleanest and most effective code for the app and gain more confidence in understanding how React works.
